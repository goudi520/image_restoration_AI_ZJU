# image_restoration_AI_ZJU
Zhejiang University Course: Artificial Intelligence (19 Spring) Individual Project -- Image Restoration.  
Course website is [here](http://10.15.82.131/cv/course/view.php?id=31).

This project uses Python 3.6.
## Discription
The task is to build regression models to reconstruct corrupted images. Input images are masked by random noise with specified noise rate. 

I implemented two regression models:
- Linear Model with Gassian Basis Function (and analysis by line, as specified in assignment instruction)
- k-Nearest Neighbor Model (which performs better)
